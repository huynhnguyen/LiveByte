# LiveByte
An open-source light-based indoor localization solution

# What is LiveByte?
LiveByte turns your smart bulbs such as Philip Hue or LIFX to indoor GPS satellites. Like GPS's method that infers device's location from the beacon signal of the GPS sattelite its can communicate, LiveByte infers location of your smart devices (mobile, wearables) from the light-beacon broadcasted by your smart bulbs. To deploy LiveByte, you only need a small and cheap server like Raspherry Pi as your bulb controller and LiveByte software installed in your phone to communicate with your smart bulb and get your location.
